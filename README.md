Tabs: Each open file is represented by a tab at the top of the Editor Group.
Split Editors: You can split the editor to work on different files concurrently by right-clicking a tab and selecting Split Right or Split Down.


4. Status Bar
The Status Bar is located at the bottom of the VS Code window and provides information about the current state of the editor and the workspace. It displays details such as:
Line and Column Number: Shows the current line and column of the cursor in the active file.
Encoding: Indicates the file's encoding (e.g., UTF-8).
EOL (End of Line): Displays the current end-of-line sequence (e.g., LF or CRLF).
Language Mode: Shows the language of the file being edited and allows you to change the language mode.
Git Branch: Displays the active Git branch and indicates any changes in the repository.
Errors and Warnings: Shows the number of errors and warnings in the current file or project.
Background Tasks: Indicates running background tasks such as build processes or extensions running tasks.

9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?

   Setting Up and Starting Debugging

1.Install Required Extensions (if necessary):

Some programming languages may require specific debugging extensions (e.g., Python, JavaScript). Install these extensions from the VS Code Marketplace (Ctrl + Shift + X) if they are not already installed.

2.Open Your Project in VS Code:
Open VS Code and navigate to the folder or workspace containing your project files (File > Open Folder).

3.Create or Open a Debug Configuration:
Click on the Run and Debug icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window, or press Ctrl + Shift + D.
If you havenâ€™t set up a debug configuration before, click on create a launch.json file, then select the environment relevant to your project (e.g., Node.js, Python, C++).
VS Code will generate a launch.json file in the .vscode directory with a basic configuration.

4.Configure Debugging Launch Configuration:
Edit the launch.json file to customize your debug configuration as needed. For example, specify the program file to debug, command-line arguments, environment variables, etc.

5.Set Breakpoints in Your Code:
Navigate to the file you want to debug in the editor.
Click in the left gutter next to the line numbers to set breakpoints. A red dot will appear, indicating the breakpoint is set.

6.Start Debugging:
Press F5 or click the Start Debugging button in the Debug view (Ctrl + Shift + D).
VS Code will launch the debugger and run your program. It will stop execution at the breakpoints youâ€™ve set, allowing you to inspect variables and step through your code.

Debugging Controls:

Once debugging starts, use the following controls from the Debug toolbar or keyboard shortcuts:
Continue (F5): Resume execution until the next breakpoint or end of the program.
Step Over (F10): Execute the current line and move to the next one.
Step Into (F11): Move to the next line, stepping into function calls if present.
Step Out (Shift + F11): Finish executing the current function and return to the caller.
Restart (Ctrl + Shift + F5): Stop the current debugging session and restart from the beginning.
Stop (Shift + F5): Terminate the debugging session.

Key Debugging Features in VS Code

Inline Debugging: View variable values directly in the editor while debugging, making it easier to understand code behavior.

Conditional Breakpoints: Set breakpoints that only trigger when specific conditions are met, enhancing flexibility in debugging.

Multi-target Debugging: Debug multiple processes or instances simultaneously using launch configurations.

Debug Console: Interact with your program by executing commands directly in the debug console while debugging.
IntelliSense in Debug Console: Benefit from IntelliSense support when typing commands in the debug console, improving command accuracy.

Exception Handling: Configure VS Code to break on unhandled exceptions or specific types of exceptions, aiding in identifying and resolving errors.


10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

    Integrating Git with Visual Studio Code (VS Code) allows developers to manage version control directly within their editor. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to initialize a repository, make commits, and push changes to GitHub using VS Code.

Integrating Git with VS Code

Install Git: Make sure Git is installed on your machine. You can download Git from git-scm.com and follow the installation instructions.

Open Your Project in VS Code: Open VS Code and navigate to the folder or workspace containing your project files (File > Open Folder).

Initialize a Git Repository:
Using VS Code:
Open the Source Control view by clicking on the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side (Ctrl + Shift + G).
Click on Initialize Repository or Initialize Git Repository if prompted. Alternatively, you can open a terminal (Ctrl + ``) and run git init` in the root of your project directory.


Stage and Commit Changes:
Stage Changes: In the Source Control view, you'll see a list of changed files. Click on the + button next to each file you want to stage, or click the + button at the top of the view to stage all changes.
Alternatively, you can stage changes by right-clicking on a file in the Explorer view and selecting Stage Changes.

Commit Changes:
Enter a commit message in the text box at the top of the Source Control view.
Press Ctrl + Enter or click the checkmark icon (âˆš) to commit the changes.

Push Changes to GitHub:
Link VS Code with GitHub: Make sure you have a GitHub account and have created a repository on GitHub where you want to push your local repository.
In VS Code, click on the ... (more actions) icon in the Source Control view and select Publish to GitHub.
Push Changes:After publishing to GitHub, you can push your commits: Click on the ... (more actions) icon in the Source Control view and select Push.
If you haven't configured your Git credentials in VS Code, you may be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password/token.

Managing Remote Repositories:

Adding a Remote Repository: If you have an existing GitHub repository that you want to link to your local repository, use the following command in the terminal:
bash
Copy code
git remote add origin <repository-url>
Replace <repository-url> with the URL of your GitHub repository.

Pulling Changes:To fetch and merge changes from the remote repository to your local repository:
bash
Copy code
git pull origin main
This command fetches changes from the main branch (replace main with your branch name if different) of the remote repository and merges them into your current branch.
